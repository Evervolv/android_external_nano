1 Introduction
**************

GNU 'nano' is a small and friendly text editor.  Besides basic text
editing, 'nano' offers many extra features, such as an interactive
search-and-replace, undo/redo, syntax coloring, smooth scrolling,
auto-indentation, go-to-line-and-column-number, feature toggles, file
locking, backup files, and internationalization support.

1.1 Overview
============

The original goal for 'nano' was a complete bug-for-bug compatible
emulation of Pico, but 'nano''s current goal is to be as compatible as
possible while offering a superset of Pico's functionality.  See *Note
Pico Compatibility::, for more info.

   The usual way to invoke 'nano' is:

     'nano [FILE]'

   But it is also possible to specify one or more options, and to edit
several files in a row.  Additionally, the cursor can be put on a
specific line of a file by adding the line number with a plus sign
before the filename, and even in a specific column by adding it with a
comma.  So the complete command synopsis is:

     'nano [OPTION]... [[+LINE[,COLUMN]|+,COLUMN] FILE]...'

   But normallly you would set your preferred options in your '.nanorc'
file.  And when the 'poslog' option is set (making 'nano' remember the
cursor position), you will rarely need to specify a line number.

   Please email any bug reports to <nano@nano-editor.org>.  Or file them
at <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano>.


File: nano.info,  Node: Command Line Options,  Prev: Overview,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Command Line Options
========================

'nano' takes the following options from the command line:

'+LINE,COLUMN'
     Start at line number LINE and column number COLUMN (at least one of
     which must be specified) instead of the default of line 1, column
     1.

'-A'
'--smarthome'
     Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at
     the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the
     cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).
     If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
     beginning of the line.

'-B'
'--backup'
     When saving a file, back up the previous version of it to the
     current filename suffixed with a '~'.

'-C DIRECTORY'
'--backupdir=DIRECTORY'
     Set the directory where 'nano' puts unique backup files if file
     backups are enabled.

'-D'
'--boldtext'
     Use bold text instead of reverse video text.

'-E'
'--tabstospaces'
     Convert typed tabs to spaces.

'-F'
'--multibuffer'
     Enable multiple file buffers (if support for them has been compiled
     in).

'-G'
'--locking'
     Enable vim-style file locking when editing files.

'-H'
'--historylog'
     Log search and replace strings to '~/.nano/search_history', so they
     can be retrieved in later sessions.

'-I'
'--ignorercfiles'
     Don't look at the system's nanorc file nor at the user's
     '~/.nanorc'.

'-K'
'--rebindkeypad'
     Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly.
     You should only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse
     support won't work properly with this option enabled.

'-L'
'--nonewlines'
     Don't add newlines to the ends of files.

'-N'
'--noconvert'
     Disable automatic conversion of files from DOS/Mac format.

'-O'
'--morespace'
     Use the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space.

'-P'
'--poslog'
     Log for each file the last location of the cursor, and read it back
     upon reopening the file and place it there again.

'-Q "CHARACTERS"'
'--quotestr="CHARACTERS"'
     Set the quoting string for justifying.  The default value is

          "^([ \t]*[|>:}#])+"

     if extended regular expression support is available, or '> '
     otherwise.  Note that '\t' above stands for a literal Tab
     character.

'-R'
'--restricted'
     Restricted mode: don't read or write to any file not specified on
     the command line; don't read any nanorc files nor history files;
     don't allow suspending nor spell checking; don't allow a file to be
     appended to, prepended to, or saved under a different name if it
     already has one; and don't use backup files.  This restricted mode
     is also accessible by invoking 'nano' with any name beginning with
     'r' (e.g.  'rnano').

'-S'
'--smooth'
     Enable smooth scrolling.  Text will scroll line-by-line, instead of
     the usual chunk-by-chunk behavior.

'-T NUMBER'
'--tabsize=NUMBER'
     Set the displayed tab length to NUMBER columns.  The value of
     NUMBER must be greater than 0.  The default value is '8'.

'-U'
'--quickblank'
     Do quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear
     after 1 keystroke instead of 25.  Note that '-c' overrides this.

'-V'
'--version'
     Show the current version number and exit.

'-W'
'--wordbounds'
     Detect word boundaries more accurately by treating punctuation
     characters as parts of words.

'-Y NAME'
'--syntax=NAME'
     Specify a specific syntax from the nanorc files to use for
     highlighting.  See *Note Syntax Highlighting::, for more info.

'-c'
'--const'
     Constantly display the cursor position and line number on the
     statusbar.  Note that this overrides '-U'.

'-d'
'--rebinddelete'
     Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and
     Delete work properly.  You should only need to use this option if
     Backspace acts like Delete on your system.

'-h'
'--help'
     Show a summary of command-line options and exit.

'-i'
'--autoindent'
     Automatically indent new lines to the same number of spaces and
     tabs as the previous line.

'-k'
'--cut'
     Make the 'Cut Text' command (normally ^K) cut from the current
     cursor position to the end of the line, instead of cutting the
     entire line.

'-l'
'--nofollow'
     When writing files, if the given file is a symbolic link, it is
     removed and a new file is created.

'-m'
'--mouse'
     Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,
     mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
     double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X
     Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.  Text can
     still be selected through dragging by holding down the Shift key.

'-n'
'--noread'
     Treat any name given on the command line as a new file.  This
     allows 'nano' to write to named pipes: it will start with a blank
     buffer, and will write to the pipe when the user saves the "file".
     This way 'nano' can be used as an editor in combination with for
     instance 'gpg' without having to write sensitive data to disk
     first.

'-o DIRECTORY'
'--operatingdir=DIRECTORY'
     Set the operating directory.  This makes 'nano' set up something
     similar to a chroot.

'-p'
'--preserve'
     Preserve the ^Q (XON) and ^S (XOFF) sequences so data being sent to
     the editor can be stopped and started.

'-q'
'--quiet'
     Do not report errors in the nanorc file nor ask them to be
     acknowledged by pressing Enter at startup.

'-r NUMBER'
'--fill=NUMBER'
     Hard-wrap lines at column NUMBER (by inserting a newline
     character).  If the given value is 0 or less, wrapping will occur
     at the width of the screen minus the given amount, allowing the
     wrapping width to vary along with the width of the screen if and
     when it is resized.  The default value is '-8'.  This option
     conflicts with '-w' - the last one given takes effect.

'-s PROGRAM'
'--speller=PROGRAM'
     Invoke the given program as the spell checker.  By default, 'nano'
     uses the command specified in the 'SPELL' environment variable, or,
     if 'SPELL' is not set, its own interactive spell checker that
     requires the 'spell' program to be installed on your system.

'-t'
'--tempfile'
     Don't ask whether or not to save the current contents of the file
     when exiting, assume yes.  This is most useful when using 'nano' as
     the composer of a mailer program.

'-v'
'--view'
     Don't allow the contents of the file to be altered.  Note that this
     option should NOT be used in place of correct file permissions to
     implement a read-only file.

'-w'
'--nowrap'
     Don't hard-wrap long lines at any length.  This option conflicts
     with '-r' - the last one given takes effect.

'-x'
'--nohelp'
     Expert Mode: don't show the Shortcut Lists at the bottom of the
     screen.  This affects the location of the statusbar as well, as in
     Expert Mode it is located at the very bottom of the editor.

     Note: When accessing the help system, Expert Mode is temporarily
     disabled to display the help-system navigation keys.

'-z'
'--suspend'
     Enable the ability to suspend 'nano' using the system's suspend
     keystroke (usually ^Z).

'-$'
'--softwrap'
     Enable 'soft wrapping'.  This will make 'nano' attempt to display
     the entire contents of any line, even if it is longer than the
     screen width, by continuing it over multiple screen lines.  Since
     '$' normally refers to a variable in the Unix shell, you should
     specify this option last when using other options (e.g.  'nano
     -wS$') or pass it separately (e.g.  'nano -wS -$').

'-a'
'-b'
'-e'
'-f'
'-g'
'-j'
     Ignored, for compatibility with Pico.

File: nano.info,  Node: Entering Text,  Next: Special Functions,  Up: Editor Basics

2.1 Entering Text
=================

'nano' is a "modeless" editor.  All keystrokes, with the exception of
Control and Meta key sequences, enter text into the file being edited.
All key sequences in 'nano' are entered using the keyboard.


File: nano.info,  Node: Special Functions,  Next: The Cutbuffer,  Prev: Entering Text,  Up: Editor Basics

2.2 Special Functions
=====================

Special functions use the Control key (Ctrl), displayed in the help and
shortcut lists as ^; the Meta key (Alt or Cmd), displayed as M-; or the
Escape key (Esc).

   * Control key sequences are entered by holding down the Ctrl key and
     pressing the desired key, or by pressing the Esc key twice and then
     pressing the desired key.
   * Pressing the Esc key twice and then typing a three-digit number
     from 000 to 255 will enter the character with the corresponding
     value.
   * Meta key sequences are entered by holding down the Meta key
     (normally the Alt key) and pressing the desired key, or by pressing
     the Esc key once and then pressing the desired key.  Certain
     operating systems "swallow" the Alt key so that it never reaches
     the application; if your operating system does this, you should use
     the Esc key to generate Meta key sequences.


File: nano.info,  Node: The Cutbuffer,  Next: The Mark,  Prev: Special Functions,  Up: Editor Basics

2.3 The Cutbuffer
=================

Text can be cut from a file, a whole line at a time, by using the 'Cut
Text' command (default key binding: ^K). The cut line is stored in the
cutbuffer.  Consecutive strokes of ^K will add each cut line to this
buffer, but a ^K after any other keystroke will overwrite the entire
cutbuffer.

   The contents of the cutbuffer can be pasted back into the file with
the 'Uncut Text' command (default key binding: ^U).

   A line of text can be copied into the cutbuffer (without cutting it)
with the 'Copy Text' command (default key binding: M-6).


File: nano.info,  Node: The Mark,  Next: The Titlebar,  Prev: The Cutbuffer,  Up: Editor Basics

2.4 The Mark
============

Text can be selected by first 'setting the Mark' (default key bindings:
^6 and M-A) and then moving the cursor to the other end of the portion
to be selected.  The selected portion of text will be highlighted in
reverse video (or in bold if you set the boldtext option).  This
selection can now be cut or copied in its entirety with a single ^K or
M-6.  Or the selection can be used to limit the scope of a
search-and-replace (^\) or spell-checking session (^T).

   Cutting or copying selected text will toggle the mark off
automatically.  If necessary, it can be toggled off manually with
another ^6 or M-A.


File: nano.info,  Node: The Titlebar,  Next: The Statusbar,  Prev: The Mark,  Up: Editor Basics

2.5 The Titlebar
================

The titlebar is the line displayed at the top of the editor.  There are
three sections: left, center and right.  The section on the left
displays the version of 'nano' being used.  The center section displays
the current filename, or "New Buffer" if the file has not yet been
named.  The section on the right will display "Modified" if the file has
been modified since it was last saved or opened.

   Special modes: When 'nano' is in "File browser" mode, the center
section will display the current directory instead of the filename.  See
*Note The File Browser::, for more info.


File: nano.info,  Node: The Statusbar,  Next: Shortcut Lists,  Prev: The Titlebar,  Up: Editor Basics

2.6 The Statusbar
=================

The statusbar is the third line from the bottom of the screen, or the
bottom line in Expert Mode.  See *Note Expert Mode::, for more info.  It
shows important and informational messages.  Any error messages that
occur from using the editor will appear on the statusbar.  Any questions
that are asked of the user will be asked on the statusbar, and any user
input (search strings, filenames, etc.)  will be input on the statusbar.


File: nano.info,  Node: Shortcut Lists,  Next: Using the Mouse,  Prev: The Statusbar,  Up: Editor Basics

2.7 Shortcut Lists
==================

The Shortcut Lists are the two lines at the bottom of the screen which
show some of the more commonly used functions in the editor.


File: nano.info,  Node: Using the Mouse,  Prev: Shortcut Lists,  Up: Editor Basics

2.8 Using the Mouse
===================

When mouse support has been configured and enabled, a single mouse click
places the cursor at the indicated position.  Clicking a second time in
the same position toggles the mark.  Clicking in the shortcut list
executes the selected shortcut.  To be able to select text with the left
button, or paste text with the middle button, hold down the Shift key
during those actions.

   The mouse will work in the X Window System, and on the console when
gpm is running.


File: nano.info,  Node: Built-in Help,  Next: Feature Toggles,  Prev: Editor Basics,  Up: Top

3 Built-in Help
***************

The built-in help system in 'nano' is available by pressing ^G. It is
fairly self-explanatory.  It documents the various parts of the editor
and the available keystrokes.  Navigation is via the ^Y (Page Up) and ^V
(Page Down) keys.  ^X exits the help system.


File: nano.info,  Node: Feature Toggles,  Next: Nanorc Files,  Prev: Built-in Help,  Up: Top

4 Feature Toggles
*****************

Toggles allow you to change certain aspects of the editor that would
normally be done via command-line options.  They are invoked via Meta
key sequences.  See *Note Special Functions::, for more info.  The
following global toggles are available:

File: nano.info,  Node: Nanorc Files,  Next: The File Browser,  Prev: Feature Toggles,  Up: Top

5 Nanorc Files
**************

The nanorc files contain the default settings for 'nano'.  They should
be in Unix format, not in DOS or Mac format.  During startup, 'nano'
will first read the system-wide settings, from /etc/nanorc (the exact
path might be different), and then the user-specific settings, from
~/.nanorc.

   A nanorc file accepts a series of "set" and "unset" commands, which
can be used to configure 'nano' on startup without using command-line
options.  Additionally, there are some commands to define syntax
highlighting and to rebind keys - *Note Syntax Highlighting::, and *Note
Rebinding Keys::.  'nano' will read one command per line.

   Options in nanorc files take precedence over 'nano''s defaults, and
command-line options override nanorc settings.  Also, options that do
not take an argument are unset by default.  So using the 'unset' command
is only needed when wanting to override a setting of the system's nanorc
file in your own '~/.nanorc'.  Options that take an argument cannot be
unset.

   Quotes inside string parameters don't have to be escaped with
backslashes.  The last double quote in the string will be treated as its
end.  For example, for the "brackets" option, '""')>]}"' will match '"',
''', ')', '>', ']', and '}'.

File: nano.info,  Node: Settings,  Next: Syntax Highlighting,  Up: Nanorc Files

5.1 Settings
============

The supported settings in a nanorc file are:

'set allow_insecure_backup'
     When backing up files, allow the backup to succeed even if its
     permissions can't be (re)set due to special OS considerations.  You
     should NOT enable this option unless you are sure you need it.

'set autoindent'
     Use auto-indentation.

'set backup'
     When saving a file, back up the previous version of it to the
     current filename suffixed with a tilde ('~').

'set backupdir "directory"'
     Set the directory where 'nano' puts unique backup files, if file
     backups are enabled.

'set backwards'
     Do backwards searches by default.

'set boldtext'
     Use bold instead of reverse video for the titlebar, statusbar, key
     combos, and selected text.  This can be overridden for the first
     three by setting the options "titlecolor", "statuscolor", and
     "keycolor".

'set brackets "STRING"'
     Set the characters treated as closing brackets when justifying
     paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only closing
     punctuation (see "punct"), optionally followed by the specified
     closing brackets, can end sentences.  The default value is

          ""')>]}"

'set casesensitive'
     Do case-sensitive searches by default.

'set const'
     Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.

'set cut'
     Use cut-to-end-of-line by default, instead of cutting the whole
     line.

'set fill NUMBER'
     Hard-wrap lines at column number NUMBER.  If NUMBER is 0 or less,
     the maximum line length will be the screen width less NUMBER
     columns.  The default value is -8.

'set functioncolor FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR'
     Specify the color combination to use for the function descriptions
     in the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.  See 'set
     titlecolor' for more details.

'set historylog'
     Enable the use of '~/.nano/search_history' for saving and reading
     search/replace strings.

'set keycolor FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR'
     Specify the color combination to use for the shortcut key combos in
     the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.  See 'set
     titlecolor' for more details.

'set locking'
     Enable vim-style lock-files for when editing files.

'set matchbrackets "STRING"'
     Set the opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket
     searches.  This may not include blank characters.  The opening set
     must come before the closing set, and the two sets must be in the
     same order.  The default value is

          "(<[{)>]}"

'set morespace'
     Use the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space.

'set mouse'
     Enable mouse support, so that mouse clicks can be used to place the
     cursor, set the mark (with a double click), or execute shortcuts.

'set multibuffer'
     Allow inserting files into their own buffers.

'set noconvert'
     Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format.

'set nofollow'
     Don't follow symlinks when writing files.

'set nohelp'
     Don't display the help lists at the bottom of the screen.

'set nonewlines'
     Don't add newlines to the ends of files.

'set nowrap'
     Don't hard-wrap text at all.

'set operatingdir "directory"'
     'nano' will only read and write files inside "directory" and its
     subdirectories.  Also, the current directory is changed to here, so
     files are inserted from this directory.  By default, the operating
     directory feature is turned off.

'set poslog'
     Save the cursor position of files between editing sessions.

'set preserve'
     Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).

'set punct "STRING"'
     Set the characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying
     paragraphs.  This may not include blank characters.  Only the
     specified closing punctuation, optionally followed by closing
     brackets (see "brackets"), can end sentences.  The default value is
     "!.?".

'set quickblank'
     Do quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear
     after 1 keystroke instead of 25.

'set quiet'
     When set, 'nano' will not report errors in the nanorc file nor ask
     them to be acknowledged by pressing Enter at startup.  If this
     option is used, it should be placed at the top of the file to be
     fully effective.

'set quotestr "STRING"'
     The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.
     This is an extended regular expression if your system supports
     them, otherwise a literal string.  The default value is

          "^([ \\t]*[#:>\\|}])+"

     if you have extended regular expression support, and "> "
     otherwise.  Note that '\\t' stands for a literal Tab character.

'set rebinddelete'
     Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and
     Delete work properly.  You should only need to use this option if
     Backspace acts like Delete on your system.

'set rebindkeypad'
     Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly.
     You should only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse
     support won't work properly with this option enabled.

'set regexp'
     Do extended regular expression searches by default.

'set smarthome'
     Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at
     the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the
     cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).
     If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
     beginning of the line.

'set smooth'
     Use smooth scrolling by default.

'set softwrap'
     Enable soft line wrapping for easier viewing of very long lines.

'set speller "spellprog"'
     Use spelling checker "spellprog" instead of the built-in one, which
     calls "spell".

'set statuscolor FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR'
     Specify the color combination to use for the statusbar.  See 'set
     titlecolor' for more details.

'set suspend'
     Allow 'nano' to be suspended.

'set tabsize NUMBER'
     Use a tab size of NUMBER columns.  The value of NUMBER must be
     greater than 0.  The default value is 8.

'set tabstospaces'
     Convert typed tabs to spaces.

'set tempfile'
     Save automatically on exit, don't prompt.

'set titlecolor FGCOLOR,BGCOLOR'
     Specify the color combination to use for the titlebar.  Valid color
     names for foreground and background are: white, black, red, blue,
     green, yellow, magenta, and cyan.  And either FGCOLOR or ,BGCOLOR
     may be left out.

'set view'
     Disallow file modification.

'set whitespace "STRING"'
     Set the two characters used to indicate the presence of tabs and
     spaces.  They must be single-column characters.  The default pair
     for a UTF-8 locale is "»·", and for other locales ">.".

'set wordbounds'
     Detect word boundaries more accurately by treating punctuation
     characters as part of a word.

5.2 Syntax Highlighting
=======================

Coloring the different syntactic elements of a file is done via regular
expressions (see the 'color' command below).  This is inherently
imperfect, because regular expressions are not powerful enough to fully
parse a file.  Nevertheless, regular expressions can do a lot and are
easy to make, so they are a good fit for a small editor like 'nano'.

   A separate syntax can be defined for each kind of file via the
following commands in a nanorc file:

'syntax "str" ["fileregex" ...]'
     Defines a syntax named "str" which can be activated via the
     -Y/-syntax command-line option, or will be automatically activated
     if the current filename matches the extended regular expression
     "fileregex".  All following "color" and "icolor" statements will
     apply to this "str" syntax until a new syntax is defined.

     The "none" syntax is reserved; specifying it on the command line is
     the same as not having a syntax at all.  The "default" syntax is
     special: it takes no "fileregex", and applies to files that don't
     match any other syntax's "fileregex".

'linter program [arg ...]'
     For the currently defined syntax, use the given program to invoke
     the linter (this overrides the speller function when defined).

'formatter program [arg ...]'
     For the currently defined syntax, use the given program to
     automatically reformat text.  Useful in certain programming
     languages (e.g.  go).

'header "regex" ...'
     For the currently defined syntax, add one or more regexes which
     will be compared against the very first line of the file to be
     edited, to determine whether this syntax should be used for that
     file.

'magic "regex" ...'
     For the currently defined syntax, add one or more regexes which
     will be compared against the result of querying the magic database
     about the file to be edited, to determine whether this syntax
     should be used for that file.  This functionality only works when
     libmagic is installed on the system and will be silently ignored
     otherwise.

'color fgcolor,bgcolor "regex" ...'
     For the currently defined syntax, display all expressions matching
     the extended regular expression "regex" with foreground color
     "fgcolor" and background color "bgcolor", at least one of which
     must be specified.  Valid colors for foreground and background are:
     white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, magenta, and cyan.  You may
     use the prefix "bright" to get a stronger color highlight for the
     foreground.  If your terminal supports transparency, not specifying
     a "bgcolor" tells 'nano' to attempt to use a transparent
     background.

'icolor fgcolor,bgcolor "regex" ...'
     Same as above, except that the expression matching is case
     insensitive.

'color fgcolor,bgcolor start="sr" end="er"'
     Display expressions which start with the extended regular
     expression "sr" and end with the extended regular expression "er"
     with foreground color "fgcolor" and background color "bgcolor", at
     least one of which must be specified.  This allows syntax
     highlighting to span multiple lines.  Note that all subsequent
     instances of "sr" after an initial "sr" is found will be
     highlighted until the first instance of "er".

'icolor fgcolor,bgcolor start="sr" end="er"'
     Same as above, except that the expression matching is case
     insensitive.

'include "syntaxfile"'
     Read in self-contained color syntaxes from "syntaxfile".  Note that
     "syntaxfile" can only contain the above commands, from "syntax" to
     "icolor".

'extendsyntax str directive [arg ...]'
     Extend the syntax previously defined as str to include new
     information.  Allows you to add a new color, icolor, magic, header,
     or linter directive to an already defined syntax.  Useful when you
     want to add to definitions from the system-installed syntax
     definitions (which are normally not writable).

6 The File Browser
******************

When reading or writing files, pressing ^T will invoke the file browser.
Here, one can navigate directories in a graphical manner in order to
find the desired file.

   Basic movement in the file browser is accomplished with the arrow
keys, page up, and page down.  More advanced movement is accomplished by
searching via ^W (or 'w') and changing directories via ^_ (or 'g').  The
behavior of the Enter (or 's') key varies by what is currently selected.
If the currently selected object is a directory, the file browser will
enter and display the contents of the directory.  If the object is a
file, this filename and path are copied to the statusbar, and the file
browser exits.


File: nano.info,  Node: Pico Compatibility,  Next: Building and Configure Options,  Prev: The File Browser,  Up: Top

7 Pico Compatibility
********************

'nano' attempts to emulate Pico as closely as possible, but there are
certain differences between the editors:

'Search and Replace History'
     As of version 1.1.99pre1 of 'nano', text entered as search or
     replace strings will be stored and can be accessed with the up/down
     arrow keys.  Previously, 'nano' offered a more consistent, but
     incompatible with Pico, method for entering search and replace
     strings.  In the old method, previous entries would be displayed by
     default as editable text in front of the cursor, as opposed to
     being bracketed and uneditable as it is in Pico.  The old behavior
     could be made compatible with Pico via the '-p' option, but recent
     versions of Pico use the '-p' option to preserve the XON and XOFF
     sequences within the editor.  Since, with the new method, search
     and replace strings can still be edited by simply hitting the up
     arrow key once, the old method was removed completely.

'Writing, Appending, or Prepending Selected Text to Files'
     Text selected using the marking key (^^) can be written out,
     appended, or prepended to a new or existing file using the WriteOut
     key (^O).

'Toggles'
     Many options which alter the functionality of the program can be
     "toggled" on or off using Meta key sequences, meaning the program
     does not have to be restarted to turn a particular feature of the
     editor on or off.  Please see the internal help function (^G) for a
     list of what functions can be toggled for a particular version of
     'nano'.  See *Note Feature Toggles::, for more info.

'Cursor Position Display'
     The output of the "Display Cursor Position" in 'nano' displays the
     current line position of the cursor, as well as the column and
     total character position.

'Interactive Replace and Spell Checker'
     It is worth noting that 'nano''s replace function is interactive,
     i.e.  it does not stop after one search string was found and
     automatically replaced.  The 'nano' implementation will pause at
     each found search string and query whether to replace this instance
     or not.  The internal spell checker operates similarly.  Note that
     there is no way to force these functions to behave in the Pico
     fashion.  As of version 1.1.99pre1, misspelled words are sorted and
     trimmed for uniqueness in the internal spell checker such that the
     words 'apple' and 'Apple' will be prompted for correction
     separately.


File: nano.info,  Node: Building and Configure Options,  Prev: Pico Compatibility,  Up: Top

8 Building and Configure Options
********************************

Building 'nano' from source is fairly straightforward if you are
familiar with compiling programs with autoconf support:

   * tar xvfz nano-x.y.z.tar.gz (where x.y.z is the version of 'nano')
   * cd nano-x.y.z/
   * ./configure
   * make
   * make install

   The possible options to './configure' are:

'--disable-browser'
     Disable the mini file browser when reading or writing files.

'--disable-color'
     Disable support for the syntax coloring of files.  This also
     eliminates the -Y command-line option, which chooses a specific
     syntax.

'--disable-extra'
     Disable extra features.  At the moment, this is just
     easter-egg-type stuff.

'--disable-help'
     Disable the help function.  Doing this makes the binary much
     smaller, but makes it difficult for new users to learn more than
     very basic things about using the editor.

'--disable-histories'
     Disable the code for the handling of the history files: the search
     and replace strings that were used, and the cursor position at
     which each file was closed.  This also eliminates the -H and -P
     command-line options, which switch on the logging of search/replace
     strings and cursor positions.

'--disable-justify'
     Disable the justify and unjustify functions.

'--disable-libmagic'
     Disable the use of the library of magic-number tests (for
     determining the file type and thus which syntax to use for
     colouring - often the tests on filename extension and header line
     will be enough).

'--disable-mouse'
     Disable all mouse functionality.  This also eliminates the -m
     command-line option, which enables the mouse functionality.

'--disable-multibuffer'
     Disable support for opening multiple files at a time and switching
     between them on the fly.  This also eliminates the -F command-line
     option, which switches the use of multiple file buffers on.

'--disable-nanorc'
     Disable support for reading the nanorc files at startup.  With such
     support, you can store custom settings in a system-wide and a
     per-user nanorc file rather than having to pass command-line
     options to get the desired behavior.  See *Note Nanorc Files::, for
     more info.  Disabling this also eliminates the -I and -q
     command-line options; the first inhibits the reading of
     nanorcfiles, and the second suppresses warnings about errors in
     those files.

'--disable-operatingdir'
     Disable setting the operating directory.  This also eliminates the
     -o command-line option, which sets the operating directory.

'--disable-speller'
     Disable use of the spell checker.  This also eliminates the -s
     command-line option, which allows specifying an alternate spell
     checker.

'--disable-tabcomp'
     Disable the tab completion code when reading or writing files.

'--disable-wrapping'
     Disable hard-wrapping of overlong lines.  This also eliminates the
     -w command-line option, which enables long-line wrapping.

'--enable-tiny'
     This option disables all the above.  It also disables some of the
     larger internals of the editor, like the marking code and the
     cut-to-end-of-line code.  It also disables the function toggles.
     By using the enabling counterpart of the above options together
     with -enable-tiny, specific features can be switched back on.

'--enable-debug'
     Enable support for runtime debug output.  This can get pretty
     messy, so chances are you only want this feature when you're
     working on the nano source.

'--disable-nls'
     Disables Native Language support.  This will disable the use of any
     available GNU 'nano' translations.

'--disable-wrapping-as-root'
     Disable hard-wrapping of overlong lines by default when 'nano' is
     run as root.

'--enable-utf8'
     Enable support for reading and writing Unicode files.  This will
     require either a wide version of curses, or a UTF-8-enabled version
     of Slang.

'--disable-utf8'
     Disable support for reading and writing Unicode files.  Normally
     the configure script auto-detects whether to enable UTF-8 support
     or not.  You can use this or the previous option to override that
     detection.

'--with-slang'
     Compile 'nano' against Slang instead of against ncurses or other
     curses libraries.
